# Physical-Development-Tracker
The Physical Development Tracker uses the theory that muscles grow in a sigmoid curve to allow for safe physical development (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3177954/, more in depth analysis in PDTAlpha.py). It takes in a goal and the estimated time to reach that goal and personalizes an exercise plan (including daily goals) for the user using a sigmoid regression. As the user continues through the program, she can input data points which the plan will refit to the curve. The program is currently being alpha tested on nursing home residents, middle aged adults, and the track team at my school to promote successful outcomes across demographics.
